# TXSTproblemSolvers
Problem Solvers is a Texas State University Club dedicated to solving hard problems published in various mathematics journals such as American Math Monthly. Each file in this repository is for a problem where we needed to create examples for pattern-analysis.
1. Binary Pallindrome - We were trying to find all numbers whose binary form is a pallindrom, and where their square was a pallindrome in binary form. Turns out it's only 1 and 3.
2. shuffleProblem - Given a sorted list of consecutive numbers from 1 to n, shuffle them by taking the top number and putting it at the bottom, and then taking the next number and putting it in a new list. Repeat until all the numbers are in the second list. We wanted to find which numbers had one return to the top after 1, 2, and 3 shuffles. We also wanted to know for number n, will it take n shuffles to return to it's origional ordering.
3. Triples - We wanted to find which set of numbers a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where c=b+1=a+2
